Sam Patterson

I'm Sam Patterson — a technical writer, developer advocate, and builder focused on open-source, AI, and privacy-preserving tools.

After working in technology policy in DC and co-founding OpenBazaar I shifted from solely writing about technology to creating it. I now build small, experimental projects that explore how AI, decentralization, and human creativity intersect — and I write about what I learn along the way.

### 🔭 **Projects I'm Proud Of**

  - [GG-GeoJSON](https://github.com/SamPatt/gg-geojson): A geography meta database and browser editing tool.
  - [FourNiner](https://github.com/SamPatt/FourNiner): A Geoguessr training tool that connects a browser with Google Street view locations to an Obsidian vault to easily create and train flashcards.

  - [StrapTo](https://github.com/SamPatt/strapto-server): A suite of apps designed to stream the output of self-hosted LLMs over WebRTC to browsers.
  - [LookMa](https://github.com/SamPatt/lookma): A React Native app built to connect locally-run LLM servers to mobile devices.
  - [LlamaTrivia](https://youtu.be/itk5oz_f27M?si=YXh4irrNuVmh1Brv): I wired up a trivia game to an LLM to see if it could beat my score (it did)
  - [Close Encounters of the Cute Kind](https://github.com/SamPatt/close-encounters-of-the-cute-kind): A game built in a week that blends classic maze navigation with a space theme, leveraging AI assets.

### 🌱 **Skills & Currently Learning** 
I honed my skills in JavaScript and Python, learning React, Node, Flask and Django. I'm familiar with MongoDB and SQL (Postgres). I'm well-versed with Git, GitHub, Bitcoin, and Linux. I've also become friends with the OpenAI, Anthropic, and Groq APIs recently, having used them in multiple projects, and now local AI models as well (using Ollama mostly). Many of my projects use WebRTC to connect browsers p2p.

### 👯 **Collaboration Interests** 
Amateur radio, AI, and decentralization projects. I have prior experience working on decentralization with [OpenBazaar](https://github.com/OpenBazaar).
