### SamPatt

I'm Sam Patterson, a software developer with more than 10 years of previous experience in tech startups and non-profits.

I've always had one foot in the tech world - working on technology policy in DC, co-founding a tech company - but I wanted to be building new things instead of writing about them. After graduating from General Assembly's immersive software engineering bootcamp, I can build them alongside others - maybe you!

### ðŸ”­ **Projects I'm Proud Of**
  - [Auto-Component](https://github.com/TimHuitt/auto-component): A React Component published on npm which helps React developers build their UI using AI.
  - [HaveWords.ai](https://github.com/SamPatt/HaveWords.ai): A p2p AI sharing site I built that allows users to join their friends and generate fiction/roleplay with an AI.
  - [Ailoquium](https://github.com/SamPatt/ailoquium): A game where you're a doctor treating a series of AI patients. Uses a Django backend to manage the OpenAI API calls, and a React frontend.
  - [pawzbe.com](https://github.com/SamPatt/pawzbe): A pet social media platform. Alongside two other great developers from my General Assembly software engineering bootcamp we built this MEN-stack app in only two weeks.
  - [Close Encounters of the Cute Kind](https://github.com/SamPatt/close-encounters-of-the-cute-kind): A game built in a week that blends classic maze navigation with a space theme, leveraging AI assets.

### ðŸŒ± **Skills & Currently Learning** 
I honed my skills in JavaScript and Python, learning React and Django. I'm familiar with MongoDB and SQL (Postgres). I'm well-versed with Git, GitHub, Bitcoin, and Linux. I've also become friends with the OpenAI API recently, having used it in multiple projects, and now local AI models as well (using LMStudio mostly). I'm currently learning React Native.

### ðŸ‘¯ **Collaboration Interests** 
Amateur radio, AI, and decentralization projects. I have prior experience working on decentralization with [OpenBazaar](https://github.com/OpenBazaar).

### âš¡ **Fun Facts**: 
  - Participated in the first HF radio transaction using Bitcoin (double nerd points!)
  - Hobbies include fencing, curling, table tennis, chess, macrophotography, and rock climbing.

Eager to continue my learning journey and collaborate on meaningful projects. Let's connect and build something cool together!
